Steganalysis with DSP filters and histogram analysis in MATLAB
Comparing histograms of original and message carrying hos timage by passing filters to identify steganography.

The difference in histogram after passing filters and analysis will reveal secret message. 
The original image is assumed to be obtained by taking screenshot of host message ridden host image. 

Retrieval method: Generate photographc copy and compare with message ridden host image.

Tests clearly show that histogram analysis can be used to detect presence of hidden data. 
it may as well reveal the secret message after deep analysis.
