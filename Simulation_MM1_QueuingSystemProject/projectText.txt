Project Phase One (Project 1)
The project's aim is to study the concept of "rare events" in simulation modeling, which is to be achieved in two phases:
Phase One (Project One): technical definition of rare events followed by an in-depth literature review of the various research work undertaken in dealing with the simulation of rare events.
Phase Two )Project Two): one of the presented techniques in phase one will be chosen and studied thoroughly with performance evaluation, indications of its shortcomings and sugestions
